# Builder Pattern

## Problem

At a busy car dealership, customers want to design their perfect car.
Some only care about the brand and engine, while others want to pick every detail — color, transmission, seating, and more.

Handling all these options at once is tricky: long constructor calls get confusing, optional features get skipped or misordered, and making changes later can accidentally break a car’s setup.
The dealership needs a way to create cars flexibly, clearly, and without errors, no matter how many features each customer chooses.
